## [1.4.3] - 2025-08-20

### Fixed
- **Target path calculation with git aliases**: Fixed critical bug where target paths were incorrectly calculated when using `git fetch-file` commands from subdirectories within a repository. Git aliases that start with `!` execute from the repository root, causing the tool to incorrectly detect the working directory as the repository root instead of the directory where the user invoked the command.
- **GIT_PREFIX environment variable support**: Now properly uses Git's `GIT_PREFIX` environment variable to determine the correct relative path from repository root to where the command was invoked, ensuring target paths are calculated correctly regardless of where the git alias runs.
- **Manifest target storage accuracy**: Target paths in the `.git-remote-files` manifest are now correctly stored relative to the git repository root, accounting for the actual directory where the command was run.

### Technical Details
- Modified `get_relative_path_from_git_root()` to use `os.environ.get('GIT_PREFIX')` instead of `Path.cwd().relative_to(git_root)`
- Enhanced conflict detection logic to handle cases where the same file from the same repository is being tracked with different target paths
- Improved target path calculation for both explicit target directories and default placement scenarios

### Examples of Fixed Behavior
Before (incorrect):
```bash
cd repo/subdir
git fetch-file add https://github.com/user/repo.git file.txt myfile.txt
# Would store: target = myfile.txt (incorrect, should be subdir/myfile.txt)
```

After (correct):
```bash
cd repo/subdir  
git fetch-file add https://github.com/user/repo.git file.txt myfile.txt
# Now stores: target = subdir/myfile.txt (correct)
```

## [1.4.2] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed
- Fixed `pull` command not updating remote-tracking files to their latest commits
- Fixed incorrect "local changes detected" warnings when pulling remote updates
- Remote-tracking files now automatically resolve to the latest commit on their branch during pulls
- Fixed grouping logic to use resolved commits instead of stored commits for remote-tracking files
- Improved local change detection to distinguish between actual user modifications and expected remote updates

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `--save` flag from `pull` command
- Remote tracking is now automatic: files with a `branch` key automatically update to latest commit, files without `branch` key remain pinned to their stored commit
- Improved user experience by making remote vs. pinned behavior more intuitive
- Added deprecated `--save` flag for backwards compatibility (shows warning and is ignored)

### Backwards Compatibility
- Scripts using `git fetch-file pull --save` will continue to work but display a deprecation warning
- The `--save` flag is now a no-op as the behavior it provided is now automatic for remote-tracking files

## [1.4.1] - 2025-08-13

### Fixed
- **Directory creation bug**: Fixed issue where `TEMP_DIR` wasn't being created before use in `pull_files` function, which could cause operations to fail
- **Test coverage**: Added test for `git fetch-file pull` command to prevent regression

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added
- **Multi-target file tracking**: Same file can now be tracked from different repositories or to different target directories without conflicts
- **Enhanced conflict detection**: Intelligent conflict detection only prevents duplicates when repository, file path, and target directory are all identical
- **Remove command**: New `git fetch-file remove <path> [<target_dir>]` command to remove tracked files from the manifest
- **Force flag for add command**: Added `--force` flag to `add` command for intentionally overwriting existing entries
- **Repository disambiguation**: `--repository` flag for remove command to disambiguate entries from different repositories

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Manifest format simplification**: All manifest sections now use unified format `[file "path" from "repository_url"]` for clarity and consistency
- **Eliminated redundant repository keys**: Repository information is now stored only in section names, eliminating duplicate `repository` keys in manifest entries
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed unnecessary helper functions, making the code more maintainable
- **Git-style error messages**: Conflict errors now use concise, git-like format: `fatal: 'file' already tracked from <repo>` with helpful hints
- **Backward compatibility**: Old manifest formats are still supported and automatically migrated

### Fixed
- **Issue #5: Cannot add same filename from two different repos**: Resolved conflict detection that incorrectly prevented tracking same filename from different repositories or to different target directories

### Improved
- **Conflict resolution guidance**: Error messages now provide clear options: use `--force` to overwrite, or specify different target directory
- **Status output clarity**: Status command shows multiple entries when same file is tracked to different locations
- **Documentation coverage**: Comprehensive README.md updates with conflict handling examples and new command documentation

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added
- **Backward compatibility for manifest format**: Automatic migration from legacy `repo` key to new `repository` key in `.git-remote-files` manifest
- **Documentation improvements**: Updated README.md with corrected manifest format examples and improved feature descriptions
- **Git-consistent options**: Added `--detach` option for commit tracking (consistent with `git checkout --detach`), while maintaining `--commit` for backward compatibility

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Manifest format standardization**: The `.git-remote-files` manifest now uses `repository` as the key instead of `repo` for consistency. Old files are automatically migrated when read
- **Commit hash storage**: The manifest now always stores actual commit hashes in the `commit` field, never symbolic references like "HEAD" or branch names
- **Dry-run accuracy**: Dry-run mode now resolves commit references to actual commit hashes before displaying output, providing accurate information about what would be stored
- **CLI argument consistency**: Updated help text and all user-facing output to use `<repository>` instead of `<repo>` for consistency

### Fixed
- **Commit reference resolution**: Fixed inconsistency where `commit_ref` could be "HEAD" in display logic, which didn't align with the requirement that manifests always store resolved commit hashes
- **Display consistency**: Eliminated confusing "HEAD" symbolic references from manifest format and user-facing output
- **Jobs parallelism documentation**: Corrected help text from "default: 4" to "default: auto" to accurately reflect the CPU-based auto-detection behavior
- **README.md accuracy**: Fixed output message casing and manifest format examples to match actual tool behavior

### Improved
- **Code organization**: Added `resolve_commit_ref()` helper function to centralize commit resolution logic and eliminate code duplication
- **User experience**: All user-facing code, variables, and help text now consistently use "repository" instead of "repo" for clarity
- **Documentation completeness**: Enhanced README.md with backward compatibility notes, corrected examples, and comprehensive feature descriptions
- **Migration transparency**: Added clear notes about v1.3.0 manifest format changes with full backward compatibility assurance
- **Git consistency**: Improved option naming with `--detach` (matching git's terminology) while preserving `--commit` for compatibility

## [1.2.2] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed
- **Concurrency crash with multiple files from same repository**: Fixed fatal crash when pulling multiple files from the same repository concurrently. The tool now groups files by repository and commit, creating a single shared clone per group instead of attempting multiple simultaneous clones to the same directory. This resolves the "Command returned non-zero exit status 128" error that occurred when using default concurrency settings

### Improved
- **Optimized concurrent fetching**: Repository cloning is now batched by repository and commit combination, reducing redundant clone operations and improving performance when fetching multiple files from the same source

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed
- **Commit hash cloning**: Fixed failure when fetching files from specific commit hashes. The tool now properly distinguishes between commit hashes (40 hex characters) and branch/tag names when cloning repositories, resolving the "returned non-zero exit status 128" error

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed
- **Directory structure preservation**: Fixed bug where glob patterns with target directories would flatten all files instead of preserving their original directory hierarchy
- **Dry-run target path calculation**: Fixed inconsistent path handling between actual fetching and dry-run mode for glob patterns

### Improved
- **Massive performance improvement for glob patterns**: Reduced repository cloning from N+1 operations (1 for discovery + 1 per file) to just 1 clone operation total
- **Git-style error messages**: Updated all error and warning messages to follow standard git command conventions:
  - Use `fatal:`, `error:`, and `warning:` prefixes appropriately
  - Lowercase message text (except proper nouns)
  - No trailing punctuation
  - Consistent tone and style with git commands

### Added
- **Informative glob feedback**: Added messages showing how many files match a glob pattern during fetching (e.g., "Found 71 files matching '**' in repository")
